## What is AppBuilder SDK?

Baidu AI Cloud Qianfan AppBuilder SDK is a `one-stop development tool` for AI native application developers which contributed by [Baidu AI Cloud Qianfan AppBuilder](https://appbuilder.cloud.baidu.com/).


We provide three types of functions from bottom to top: basic components, process orchestration, and end-to-end applications. With Baidu AI Cloud Qianfan AppBuilder SDK, you can:

- Cooperate with Baidu AI Cloud Qianfan AppBuilder platform [web side](https://console.bce.baidu.com/ai_apaas/app), Build an end-to-end AI native application that includes Baidu's industrial practices at the minute level: Agent / RAG / Workflow application

- Collaborate with basic components and process orchestration to build personalized `Assistant` + `FunctionCall` applications in a modular manner

- Provide two service-oriented deployment methods: API calls and interactive windows, supporting fast cloud deployment


##  How to install？

#### The latest version of Baidu AI Cloud Qianfan AppBuilder SDK is 0.8.0 (2024-06-07)

Baidu AI Cloud Qianfan AppBuilder SDK ReleaseNote please refer to our [version description](/docs/quick_start/changelog.md)

- We recommend installing the latest stable version of `Python`

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade appbuilder-sdk
```
- For installation of `Java` and `Go` versions, as well as using `Docker` images, please refer to the [Installation Instructions](/docs/quick_start/install.md)


## Quickly start your first AI native application!

- Please install `appbuilder sdk` in a Python environment with `>=3.9` and use this end-to-end application example
- The example provides a trial token, but access and QPS are restricted. Please replace it with your personal token for official use
- The application in the example is: [Geography expert](https://appbuilder.baidu.com/s/x1tSF), Click on the link to try it out on the web page

#### Code example

```python
import appbuilder
import os

# Set the TOKENs in the environment. The following TOKENs are trial TOKENs with restricted access and QPS. Please replace them with your personal TOKENs for official use
os.environ["APPBUILDER_TOKEN"] = "bce-v3/ALTAK-n5AYUIUJMarF7F7iFXVeK/1bf65eed7c8c7efef9b11388524fa1087f90ea58"

# Obtain and pass in the application ID from the AppBuilder webpage. The following is the application ID of the Geography Expert
app_id = "42eb211a-14b9-43d2-9fae-193c8760ef26"

app_builder_client = appbuilder.AppBuilderClient(app_id)
conversation_id = app_builder_client.create_conversation()

answer = app_builder_client.run(conversation_id, "Where is the capital of the United States and what is the climate like? answer by english")
print(answer.content)
```

#### Answer display

> The capital of the United States is **Washington, D.C.**^[1]^.
